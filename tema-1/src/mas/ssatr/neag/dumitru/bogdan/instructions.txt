Instructions:

1. Clone/pull github repo https://github.com/NeagB/iaisc-2020-ssatr-31312-neag-dumitru-bogdan.
2. Upload the project folder "tema-1" into your favorite IDE (e.g. Intellij IDEA).
3. It is necessary to add the json-simple-1.1.jar library as external library.
3. Modify the json (src/mas/ssatr/neag/dumitru/bogdan/input/retea-petri.json) file as you wish or leave it as it is.
4. Run Main.java .
5. See the output of the simulation in the .txt file (src/../output/simulation-result.txt).
 The output file .txt has the following structure: Time (current time HH:MM:ss) and the PN mark (P0->token...Pn->token)

Optional: simulation logic:

call method evaluate(){

	while(P.N. can be executed){
		write the mark in the output file
		check if any transition can be exuted -> if yes =>fire(){ take token from input location->  move token to the 									output location(s)}
		if initial mark is reached OR worst case scenario has been reached => stop simulation
								
	}		
}
